## How to Deploy an ASP.NET Application in Docker:
To use Docker to deploy your ASP.NET application, you must first build a Dockerfile. This file specifies how your application will be developed and packaged for use in a Docker container. Using the ‘docker build’ command, you can generate a container image after you have built your Dockerfile. After your image has been created, you may start your container with the **‘docker run’** command.

## Edit the Contents of the Dockerfile
Dockerfiles are simple to use and enable easy versioning and customization. They are used to define the process of creating Docker container images. A **Dockerfile** is a text file that contains a set of instructions for Docker to build an image. It consists of the following sections:

- **FROM** – specifies the base image on which you want to build your image
- **MAINTAINER** – identifies the person who maintains this repository and/or its contents (optional)
- **COPY** – copies files from paths in your local machine into newly created layers of your container at runtime
- **RUN** – runs commands inside new layers as they are created with COPY statements or ADD commands

Here is how the Dockerfile looks in Visual Studio:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["RealEstate/RealEstate.csproj", "RealEstate/"]
RUN dotnet restore "RealEstate/RealEstate.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/RealEstate"
RUN dotnet build "RealEstate.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "RealEstate.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "RealEstate.dll"]
```

With **Docker Compose**, you can create and run multi-container applications. This is useful for situations where you need to run multiple containers, such as when you are running a web application and a database.

## Command to Deploy the ASP.NET Application in Docker
Once you have built your application successfully, open a command window in administrator mode and execute the following command to create the Docker image:

```
docker build -t dockerrealestateapi .
```

And, that is it!

How to Run the **Docker Image**
To execute the Docker image we created earlier, you can use the following command at the command window:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name testapp dockerealestateapi
```
